		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QntT9owoV0" target="_blank"> <h2> Scottish Fold </h2> </a>
			<p> Scottish Fold cats have bended ears that make them look almost earless. With round, full faces, and large, circular eyes, this can 
			give Scottish Folds an owlish look. The breed developed from a cat named Susie, from Scotland, who had folded ears when she was discovered 
			by a shepherd in 1961. </p>

			<p> These cool looking cats come from Thailand, where their name means “White Gem.” These cats have been coveted for almost a thousand 
			years, with creamy white coats and bright eyes of green, blue or gold—or odd (two different colors).</p>

			<p> Technically, the Teacup Persian isn’t a strange cat breed of its own—it’s a variety of Persian cat that’s been bred to be extremely 
			small. Some are so tiny they can fit in the palm of your hand. </p>
